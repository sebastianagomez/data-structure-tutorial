# Programming with Data Structures

Welcome to this programming with Data Structure tutorial using Python.

## Introduction

In this tutorial I will cover three data structures: Trees, Linked List and Stacks. For each data structure, I will introduce them, when we can use them and its benefits. Also, I will share with you some code examples and a code challenge so you can practice.
